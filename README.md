# Weakly-Supervised-3D-Classification-of-Chest-CT-using-Aggregated-Multi-Resolution-Deep-Segmentation-
This Repo contains the updated implementation of our paper "Weakly supervised 3D classification of chest CT using aggregated multi-resolution deep segmentation features", Proc. SPIE 11314, Medical Imaging 2020: Computer-Aided Diagnosis, 1131408 (16 March 2020).

* Version-1: Implemented Segmentation Module and Classification Seperately and was in Tensorflow 1.x
Can be seen here: https://github.com/anindox8/Deep-Segmentation-Features-for-Weakly-Supervised-3D-Disease-Classification-in-Chest-CT

* Version-2: Updated the Implementation , For reducing computation expenses the Segmenation Module and Classifiction Module is combined,updated implementation is in Tensorflow 2.0. This implemnetation is 2 times faster than the Version-1 in terms of training. Also Project has been moved from multi-class to multi-label classification setup (Follow the SPIE presentation for clear idea).
